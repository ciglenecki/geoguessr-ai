## üß† Brainstorming

- Create a grid for Croatia. Each square of a grid represents a class. Instead of regression, try classificaion where these squares will be different classes. Classification should have a probabilistic interpretation. Multiply probabilities (the certainty of each block) to get the final coordinate. Size of the square is a hyperparameter.

- Distance from each coordinate point is not linear. Use the transformation caculates the real world distance between cooridantes. The earth is round!

- How do we exploit the fact that the real input is 4 images? We can naively classify all 4 images and then average classifications to get a single coordinate. Is there a better way? Maybe we can concatenate 4 images into a single image (360 view) ? If we can't concatenate images, which model arhitecture should be taken into account?

## üìù Todo

- [] Sanity image check - open some images during the training to see if they make sense

- [] Regression - Create a haversine loss functions by using torch tensor operations (you can't use sklearn). Then, replace the existing loss function. Haversine distance is similar to a residual. It might be useful to square the Haversine distance to get similar formula to MSE.
  - [] Outside of Croatia bound classification - prediction gives softmax of values; weighted sum ends up in Bosna, what do we do?
    - Solution 1: find the closest point on the border
    - Solution 2: increase the loss
    - Solution 3: do nothing; model might fit the Croatia borders implicitly

- [] Train/val/test explicit split - What is train set? Currently, dataset is randomimzed each time training is started. We didn't explicitly define the split (by directories) but we should. The easiest way seems to be to edit the dataframe where we have train, val, test flags

- [] Normalization - caculate normalization on the train dataset (once the task above is done). You need to get mean=[?,?,?], std=[?,?,?]

- [] Haver sine logging - add at the end of the epoch in val, at every step in test and ad end of the epoch in test


- [] monitored value (that we EarlyStop on) should be great-circle distance and not val_loss. This is done by recording heversine as a metric via the self.logger. When hyperparameter is logged it can be used as a metric for EarlyStop.

- [] Optional: project to CRS (?) then caculate distances, then re-project (?). This is useful if we use regression and non-havesine distance but something linear. By not projecting-reprojecting, the spacing between squares is not correct. Adding/subracting angles doesn't change affect the distance linearly.

- [] Optional: implement polygons on the border; these are addional classes which are expliclty defined. These classes might clash with already exising classes (polygons). How? There might be a polygon which is close to the border and overlaps the explicitly defined polygon. Solution is to remove the intersection so that polygons don't overlap. Polygon on the border (the one that is explicitly defined) should have prioirty over getting more surface area.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Setup

Setup virtual environment:

```bash
[ ! -d "venv" ] && (echo "Creating python3 virtual environment"; python3 -m venv venv)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

### CSV dataframe:
uuid, lat, lng, class(polygon_index)

### Lightning
[Multiple Datasets
](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/data.html#multiple-datasets)

There are a few ways to pass multiple Datasets to Lightning:
- Create a DataLoader that iterates over multiple Datasets under the hood.
- In the training loop you can pass multiple DataLoaders as a dict or list/tuple and Lightning will automatically combine the batches from different DataLoaders.
- In the validation and test loop you have the option to return multiple DataLoaders, which Lightning will call sequentially.
